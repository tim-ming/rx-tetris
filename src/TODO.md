- Why I separate Border into separate class

  - Because I don't want the willCollide() method to be floating somewhere in the code, but better contained in the Border class
  - Also bottom can be raised in the future, so it's better to have it in a separate class (more extensibility!)

- [ ] SRS rotation

- [ ] Tetris DS scoring system
